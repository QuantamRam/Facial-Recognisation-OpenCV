# 😎 Face Recognition using OpenCV in C++

Welcome to the world of **Face Recognition**—where your computer gains the ability to recognize you (or your cat, depending on your dataset) in images and video streams. This project uses the OpenCV library in C++ and is built with the almighty CMake.

## 🔧 Installation

### Prerequisites
Before diving in, make sure you've got your developer toolkit ready:
- **CMake**: The Swiss Army knife of C++ builds. Get it [here](https://cmake.org/download/).
- **OpenCV**: The magic library that makes your computer see. Installation guide [here](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d7/d9f/tutorial_linux_install.html).

### Build the Project

1. **Clone the repository** (because copy-pasting code from Stack Overflow doesn't always cut it)
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-recognition-opencv-cpp.git
    cd face-recognition-opencv-cpp
    ```

2. **Create a build directory** (because cluttering your root directory is so 2000s)
    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ```

3. **Configure the project using CMake**
    ```bash
    cmake ..
    ```

4. **Build the project** (and hope your compiler isn't in a bad mood today)
    ```bash
    cmake --build .
    ```

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Run the executable** (and see if your computer finally recognizes you)
   ```bash
   ./FaceRecognition --source <image_path_or_video_device_index>
